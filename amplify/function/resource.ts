import { defineFunction } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

// Simplified approach - we'll create the Pinpoint project manually
// and provide the Project ID as an environment variable
export const sendSmsFunction = defineFunction({
  entry: '../../lambda/send-sms/index.js',
  environment: {
    // This will be set manually after creating the Pinpoint project
    PINPOINT_PROJECT_ID: 'REPLACE_WITH_PINPOINT_PROJECT_ID'
  }
});

// Note: After deployment, we'll need to:
// 1. Create a Pinpoint project manually in the AWS console
// 2. Enable the SMS channel for the project
// 3. Update the Lambda function's environment variable with the Pinpoint Project ID
// 4. Add IAM permissions for the Lambda function to use Pinpoint
